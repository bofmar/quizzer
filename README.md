# Quizzer
An online quiz game made as an exercise in React. See it live [here](https://bofmar.github.io/quizzer).

The page queries the [Open Trivia DB](https://opentdb.com/) to get 5 random questions and displays them for the user to answer. After that the user is given feedback on how many questions he got right, and can start another round with new questions.

Demonstrates the use of states, props, useEffect and useRef.
